The Social Media Data Analysis Project is designed to analyze social media data to uncover insights about user behavior, engagement, and growth trends. This project utilizes SQL to perform various queries on a dataset representing a hypothetical social media platform. Key features of the project include:

Database Setup: The database schema (social_media_database.sql) sets up tables to store user information, posts, follower counts, and more.
Data Analysis Queries: A set of SQL queries (social_media_queries.sql) is provided to analyze the data, including:
1. Identifying users with the most followers.
2. Calculating follower growth rates over time.
3. Analyzing user engagement through followers-to-following ratios.
4. Tracking the growth of user accounts created over time.
 5.Discovering trends in posting activity.
